This is a WIP MSNP11-12 server written in Rust. Most protocol features are already working.

Its intention is to eventually leverage the extensible nature of [Polyproto](https://github.com/polyphony-chat) in order to create a federated revival of the service. That way people can spin up their own instances while still being able to talk to each other.
