		<h1>R²M</h1>
		<p>
			R²M, or Rusty Retro Messaging, is a third-party MSNP server written in Rust.
		</p>
		<h2>Status of the project</h2>
		<p>
			It currently supports MSNP11 and MSNP12, i.e. what MSN 7.0 and MSN 7.5 use, and has most protocol features working, including
			messaging and most contact actions.
		</p>
		<p>
			The server is actually available for private testing, if you have a code you can register on the top right and use
			one of the patched installers <a href={storageUrl}>here</a>. Or you can point your client to this same domain.
		</p>
		<h2>Open source</h2>
		<p>
			This project is to be completely open source, as such the source code is available
			<a href="https://github.com/campos02/rusty-retro-messaging">here.</a>
		</p>
		<h2>Future plans</h2>
		<p>
			Eventually, when <a href="https://github.com/polyphony-chat">Polyproto</a> is more mature, this project intends to use
			it in order to turn into a federated service.
		</p>
		<p class="disclaimer">
			R²M is not affiliated with Microsoft in any way. It was created using publicly available documentation
			written by third-parties reverse engineering MSNP.
