		<h1>R²M</h1>
		<p>
			R²M, or Rusty Retro Messaging, is a third-party MSNP server written in Rust aiming to eventually become a federated
			revival of MSN Messenger. This will be achieved by making use of
			<a href="https://github.com/polyphony-chat">Polyproto</a> and its extensible nature.
		</p>
		<h2>Why federated?</h2>
		<p>
			A recurring issue in the revival scene is that servers have a strong network effect, as they can't communicate in a way
			defined by MSNP. Federation will solve that exactly by allowing user-hosted instances to talk to each other.
		</p>
		<h2>Status of the project</h2>
		<p>
			Currently the MSNP server itself is in development. It supports MSNP11 and MSNP12, i.e. what MSN 7.0 and MSN 7.5 use, and
			has most protocol features working.
		</p>
		<p>
			The server is actually available for private testing, if you have a code you can register on the top right and we have
			a couple patched installers <a href={storageUrl}>here</a>.
			Please note that accounts created now may be lost when the Polyproto integration takes effect.
		</p>
		<h2>Open source</h2>
		<p>
			This project is to be completely open source, as such the source code is available
			<a href="https://github.com/campos02/rusty-retro-messaging">here.</a>
		</p>
		<p class="disclaimer">
			R²M is not affiliated with Microsoft in any way. It was created using publicly available documentation
			written by third-parties reverse engineering MSNP.
